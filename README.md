### Do not work

❓ You tell me.

This API was developed by me for study reasons. I will use it in a future project I’m planning to do: Analyzing eSports Market Trends.

Until then I will be updating this tool to fulfill my needs until I find it is close to perfect for me. Every change I do I’ll try to put in the comment section of the commits since this is not an app yet and I do not have release notes :).
